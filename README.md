OVERVIEW

(note, web browsers will mess up the syntax of this document, but it will be right when downloaded and reading the README.md file)

This ZIP package is intended to be used with a Raspberry Pi RetroPie/Attract Mode build.

The included shell scripts are setup for use with RetroPie only.

For users who are using Attract Mode as their front-end, this ZIP package contains a display called Attract Mode Setup.  This display is equivalent to the RetroPie menu within Emulation Station.

This display is used for general configuration of Attract Mode as well as providing almost all of the same options as the Emulation Station RetroPie menu.

------------
INSTALLATION

Once the ZIP package is downloaded and extracted, copy all of the included files and folder to their equivalent folder on RetroPie. 

NOTE: the /home/pi/.attract folder is a hidden folder so you may have to enable show hidden files in your SFTP program.

The included ZIP file contains a folder called attract.  This folder is equivelent to /home/pi/.attract.  Navigate to that folder on the Pi and then transfer the files and folders into it.

You should end up with a directory structure like this. 

/home/pi/.attract/Attract Mode Setup
/home/pi/.attract/emulators   - this folder should have already existed
/home/pi/.attract/romlistss   - this folder should have already existed

The included emulator configuration file and romlist file will establish the path locations.

Restart Attract Mode.

After restart, you will possibly need to add the new display.

Press TAB
Choose Displays
Name it:  Attract Mode Setup

Assign the new display a layout to use and also choose the romlist called Attract Mode Setup.

Press ESC/BACK to navigate back to your main menu.

The new display should be visible.
